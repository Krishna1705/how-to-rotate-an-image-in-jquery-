# how-to-rotate-an-image-in-jquery-

There is Plugin called JQueryRotate is available on web,so that we don't need to do too much code to apply rotate animation on image using JQuey.
we can rotate image it with less code.you just need to download this plugin and need to add this jQueryRotate.js file into your project.
and you can apply rotate animation using its method.
here i have taken two examples:
1)By default image rotation
2)Manually Image Rotation on some event trigger

$(".auto-rotation2").rotate(ang)  is responsible for the image rotation, 
here we can set the rotation by the angle and the interval duration in code. 
So we can manage the speed and other behaviour of rotation as per the requirement.

This code is very helpful for the implementation of image rotation using JQUERY in any web app.
